Envious and admires the way the BRITISH GOVERNMENT has delivered vaccine to its population. The UK hope things can settle down and folk can STOP MAKING THREATS start to work constructively together. All against an acknowledged backdrop of: - Millions of Astra/Zeneca doses in storage in Europe and not being used. Track record of member states is absolutely lamentable compared to other countries like the UK. Acknowledges UK is faster in protecting its citizens. Philippe Lamberts accepts AstraZeneca has been the subject of a scurrilous campaign at the top of European politics in SUGGESTING THINGS ABOUT THE VACCINE THAT WERE NOT TRUE (shock horror! admitting lies). Acknowledges, reactions and publicly conducting AstraZeneca bashing by high level politicians in Europe that are completely over-the-top. This has caused confusion among Europeam citizens. This is one side of the quarrel. I wonder what AstraZenecaï¿½s side is? I speculate; A/Z may claim normal manufacturing problems in scale up and knock-on effect on deliveries? A/Z may claim, to have quite rightly prioritised their earliest legal contracts? A/Z may claim, the EU Commission was several months behind other customers in placing an order. A/Z may claim, the EU has millions of doses in storage not being used. A/Z may claim, The vaccine is no good in storage but needs to be I peoples arms. A/Z may claim, France gave away vaccine because they did not want it. A/Z may remind everyone they are performing manufacture and supply on a none profit basis at the moment.
